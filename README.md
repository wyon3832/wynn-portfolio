## Project 1: ADHD Behavior on Twitter ‚Äî An NLP Exploration

This project analyzes behavioral patterns in tweets by users who self-identify as having ADHD. Using topic modeling (LDA) and clustering (K-means), it explores how language use reveals cognitive and emotional trends.

- **Tech Stack**: Python, Pandas, Scikit-learn, Gensim, NLTK, Matplotlib
- **Techniques**: LDA Topic Modeling, TF-IDF, K-means Clustering
- **Notebook**: [`adhd_twitter_analysis.ipynb`]()

Key Insights:
- ADHD-related tweets often highlight cycles of focus issues, emotional struggle, and disrupted routines.
- Topic evolution suggests shifting awareness and terminology (e.g., increased use of "executive dysfunction" after 2020).
